of traditional neuroscience conferences during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, including two such meetings
amongst the Canadian neuroscience community. The absence of these meetings presented an opportunity to create a brand-new,
entirely virtual academic meeting that could take full advantage of the online setting. Given that traditionally-defined
trainees and early-career researchers were arguably most impacted by the cancellation of the networking and learning
opportunities that conferences present, CCNS was designed as a “trainee-focused” meeting, highlighted by tutorial talks
beginning each session, panel discussions with both established and early-career scientists, and a spotlight on trainee
presentations.</p><p>The <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008485">first edition of CCNS</a> was planned and implemented entirely in ten weeks and yielded a meeting with more than 450
registrants, including representation from every continent across the globe. Perhaps most importantly, the limited costs
of the virtual setting allowed the meeting to be completely free of charge for all attendees. Every element of the meeting
remains available for replay online, another benefit of the virtual setting. This success served as the impetus for making
CCNS a recurring academic meeting.</p><p>Going forward, CCNS will continue to highlight cutting-edge computational neuroscience research, both in Canada and around
the world, while providing unique learning, networking, and presentation opportunities for early-career researchers. The
meeting is committed to remaining cost-accessible to the entire academic community, using the virtual setting to maximize
accessibility for populations for which physical conferences present a challenge, and maintaining a gender-balanced and
diverse lineup of speakers during its continued evolution.</p></article><article id=01-overview><h2 class=major>01-Overview</h2><span class="image main"><img src alt></span><figure class="image main"><img src=/images/computational_genomics.jpg></figure><p>The <strong>Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics</strong> is excited to offer a *** two-week summer course on the
integration of multi-scale neuroscience data*** - encompassing **genetics**, **brain structure and function**, and **cognition** –
designed to introduce participants to the concepts and methods behind psychiatric neuroinformatics. Daily sessions will
include both didactic teaching and hands-on tutorial components aimed at engaging critical thinking and developing
practical skills in key selected areas. Through a series of experiments using real-world data types, participants will
uncover the links between modalities of human genomics, neuronal electrophysiology, structural and functional
neuroimaging, and observed behaviour that KCNI scientists are integrating to study mental illness.</p><p>All participants will take part in each full day of training. While the course is designed with a unified dataset and shared
series of tutorials, students will have the opportunity for <em>project-specific discussions</em>, <em>collaboration</em>, and <em>guidance</em>
outside of structured time. Lectures will be led by members and affiliates of the KCNI team, including faculty at the
University of Toronto’s Department of Psychiatry.</p><p>This unique course will prepare participants to handle and analyze multiple data types in hopes that their own research
may benefit from collaborative, multi-modal approaches. Critically, participants will also learn about best practices for
data management and quality control in the context of integrative analysis as well as ethical considerations. Students will explore the ethical dimensions of data collection, curation and model building and their impact on fairness and health equity using concrete tools and best practices</p><p>*** Lesson content (recordings and code) from last years summer course are available <a href=https://github.com/krembilneuroinformatics/kcni-school-lessons>here</a>***</p></article><article id=02-organizing-committee><h2 class=major>02 - Organizing Committee</h2><span class="image main"><img src alt></span><figure class="image main"><img src=images/screenshot.png></figure><h2 id=about-the-organizing-committee>About the Organizing Committee</h2><p><a href=http://scottrich.strikingly.com/><strong>Dr. Scott Rich</strong></a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/RichCompNeuro>@RichCompNeuro</a>, <em><strong>CCNS lead organizer</strong></em>) is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Krembil Research Institute.
His research aims to elucidate the multi-scale interactions driving physiological brain activity by better understanding how they are disrupted in epilepsy, a distinctly multi-scale pathology. This work includes a focus on distinctly human epilepsy by integrating human electrophysiological data into the modeling process.</p><p><a href=cognemo.com><strong>Dr. Andreea Diaconescu</strong></a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/cognemo_andreea>@cognemo_andreea</a>, <em><strong>CCNS co-organizer</strong></em>) is currently an Independent Scientist at the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. Leading the Cognitive Network Modelling team, her research focuses on developing cognitive tasks and computational models that address specific symptoms in psychiatry with a particular focus on delusions. In combination with neuroimaging and electrophysiological recordings, the aim is to assess the clinical utility of these models in prospective patient studies</p><p><a href=grifflab.com><strong>Dr. John Griffiths</strong></a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/neurodidact>@neurodidact</a>, <em><strong>CCNS co-organizer</strong></em>) is a cognitive and computational neuroscientist, with particular research interests in mathematical modelling of large-scale neural dynamics, multimodal neuroimaging data analysis methods, and brain stimulation in the context of neuropsychiatric and neurological disease. He is currently an Independent Scientist at the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at CAMH, where he leads a team focused on whole-brain and multi-scale neurophysiological modelling. He is also an Assistant Professor in the University of Toronto Departments of Psychiatry and Institute of Medical Sciences.</p><p><a href=https://sites.google.com/view/lnsbsp/home><strong>Dr. Milad Lankarany</strong></a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/MLankarany>@MLankarany</a>, <em><strong>CCNS co-organizer</strong></em>) is an Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto Instiute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, and a Scientist at the Krembil Research Institute. The main focus of his lab&rsquo;s work is to uncover information processing mechanisms of neural systems. His goal is to understand how information is represented, propagated and computed. Understanding neural information processing will result in the development of computational algorithms and engineering techniques for the optimal controlling of the functionality of neural systems. For example, closed loop neuro-stimulators can be used to adaptively intervene with the neural system of patients with neurological disorders in order to restore the normal activity.</p></article><article id=02-topics><h2 class=major>02-Topics</h2><span class="image main"><img src alt></span><figure class="image main"><img src=/images/brain_circuit_modelling.jpg></figure><h2 id=major-topics-covered>Major topics covered:</h2><ul><li><strong>Psychiatric epidemiology</strong> and framing the central issue of heterogeneity in mental illness</li><li><strong>Psychiatric genetics</strong>, translating germ-line genetic variation into individual brain function</li><li><strong>Neuronal population activity</strong> in cortical microcircuits, and the relationship to brain signals observable in clinic</li><li><strong>Whole-brain</strong> meso-scale structural and functional variation</li><li>Bayesian models of <strong>perception and learning;</strong> applications to neuroimaging and electroencephalography</li><li><strong>Population-based subtyping</strong> and the identification of genetically determined neural dynamics in clinical cohorts</li><li><strong>Putting it all together:</strong> using whole-person data from each scale to identify subtypes of psychiatric patients with
