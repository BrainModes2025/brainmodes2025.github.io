## Major topics covered:

- **Psychiatric epidemiology** and framing the central issue of heterogeneity in mental illness  
- **Psychiatric genetics**, translating germ-line genetic variation into individual brain function  
- **Neuronal population activity**Â in cortical microcircuits, and the relationship to brain signals observable in clinic  
- **Whole-brain** meso-scale structural and functional variation  
- Bayesian models of **perception and learning;** applications to neuroimaging and electroencephalography
- **Population-based subtyping** and the identification of genetically determined neural dynamics in clinical cohorts  
- **Putting it all together:** using whole-person data from each scale to identify subtypes of psychiatric patients with
distinct symptomatic and functional trajectories using biostatistical approaches 
- **Ethics, Fairness and Health Equity:** Explore the ethical dimensions of data collection, curation and model building and their impact on fairness and health equity using concrete tools and best practices 


## Learning Objectives

Participants will be introduced to all the topics listed below via our **public virtual learning materials and online Q&A sessions**:

- Understand the fundamental concept of Psychiatric genetics
- Learn how to integrate psychiatric genetics  with multi-omics data (incl.  Single-cell transcriptomics)
- Learn how to model neuronal population activity in cortical circuits
- Learn how to model whole-brain macro-connectomics and neural dynamics
- Learn how to apply Bayesian models of perception & learning used to neuroimaging & electrophysiological data
- Integrate Psychiatric epidemiology and apply Population-based subtyping
- Ethics, fairness and health equity in Al and healthcare
- Understand collection and analysis of real-world data in mental health  

In addition, participants selected for project week will study with an **in-depth focus on at least two of the above-listed topics** and apply that knowledge in self-directed learning projects.
