## Major topics covered:

- **Psychiatric epidemiology** and framing the central issue of heterogeneity in mental illness  
- **Psychiatric genetics**, translating germ-line genetic variation into individual brain function  
- **Neuronal population activity**Â in cortical microcircuits, and the relationship to brain signals observable in clinic  
- **Whole-brain** meso-scale structural and functional variation  
- Bayesian models of **perception and learning;** applications to neuroimaging and electroencephalography
- **Population-based subtyping** and the identification of genetically determined neural dynamics in clinical cohorts  
- **Putting it all together:** using whole-person data from each scale to identify subtypes of psychiatric patients with
distinct symptomatic and functional trajectories using biostatistical approaches 
- **Ethics, Fairness and Health Equity:** Explore the ethical dimensions of data collection, curation and model building and their impact on fairness and health equity using concrete tools and best practices 

Participants will be introduced to all the topics listed below via our (virtual learning series)[https://kcniconfluence.camh.ca/display/ED/KCNI+School+Virtual+Learning+Series]:

- Understand the fundamental concept of Psychiatric genetics
- Learn how to integrate psychiatric genetics  with multi-omics data (incl.  Single-cell transcriptomics)
- Learn how to model neuronal population activity in cortical circuits
- Learn how to model whole-brain macro-connectomics and neural dynamics
- Learn how to apply Bayesian models of perception & learning used to neuroimaging & electrophysiological data
- Integrate Psychiatric epidemiology and apply Population-based subtyping
- Ethics, fairness and health equity in Al and healthcare
- Understand collection and analysis of real-world data in mental health
