## Project Week 2022

Students will be provided with a collection of virtual didactic teaching (lectures) and hands-on tutorial components to engage critical thinking and develop practical skills in crucial selected areas. Lessons will be led by members and affiliates of the KCNI team, including faculty at the University of Torontoâ€™s Department of Psychiatry.  

Successful applications to Project Week will be mentored (in-person or hybrid) by KCNI Scientists as they complete one-week intensive group projects matched to their interests. These projects will allow participants to build mastery in selected integrative research methods. All project week participants will take part in each full day of training. Students will have the opportunity for project-specific discussions, collaboration, and guidance outside of structured time. Students will present their group project to KCNI Scientists at the conclusion of Project Week. Project week will occur in person at CAMH KCNI and be supplemented by multiple networking, collaboration, and socializing opportunities.
