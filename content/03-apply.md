## Application Process (Project Week)

Applications for participantion in project week (July 4-8, 2022) are closed April 15, 2022.

**Sorry, applications for 2022 now closed**

We will be contacting those selected to attend the summer school with an invitation to register. This year, we intend our project week will be offered **in-person** (barring new pandemic restrictions), at the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics in the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (250 College Street) Toronto, Canada.


## Eligibility and prerequisites: 

Applications from graduate students, post-graduate research and clinical fellows, as well as early-career scientists will be considered. 

To ensure that all attendees can fully follow and benefit from the practical assignments, some minimal and demonstrable experience in R and Python is a minimum requirement. 

No previous formal training in psychiatry or informatics is necessary, however - and researchers from diverse backgrounds (e.g. medicine, computer science, biology, psychology, engineering etc.) are encouraged to apply.


**Total Enrolment (project week):** 30
