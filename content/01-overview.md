The Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics is excited to offer a **five-day intensive project-based learning week** where trainees will learn hands-on techniques for integrating multi-scale neuroscience data. This course is designed to introduce participants to the concepts and methods behind psychiatric neuroinformatics - encompassing **genetics, brain structure and function, and cognition**. In addition, participants will uncover the links between modalities of human genomics, neuronal electrophysiology, structural and functional neuroimaging, and observed behaviour that KCNI scientists are integrating through a series of virtual modules and a group-based project using real-world data types to study mental illness.  

This unique learning opportunity will prepare participants to handle and analyze multiple data types in hopes that their own research may benefit from collaborative, multi-modal approaches. Critically, participants will also learn about best practices for data management and quality control in the context of integrative analysis.
