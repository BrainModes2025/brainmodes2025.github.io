## The BrainModes Conference

BrainModes is an annual international meeting of mathematical and computational neuroscientists, discussing their latest work on theories and principles of brain dynamics and functional organization.

The name is a nod to the broad concept of ***(eigen)modes***. It reflects a philosophical and theoretical orientation shared amongst its community of attendees and organizers: the idea that *both the brain and the mind, although complex and nonlinear, are ultimately low-dimensional dynamical objects.* And, moreover, that this property is key to understanding, measurement, and therapeutic control of neural systems. 

Scientific discussions at BrainModes are varied and lively, as the conference attracts scientists from a wide range of neuroscience (and non-neuroscience) sub-fields, including a mix of experimentalists, data analysts, and theoreticians. All of the work discussed involves some combination of concepts from statistical physics, dynamical systems, complexity science, machine learning - which serve as guides and tools for thinking through neuroscientific ideas and research questions. 

See [here](https://www.brainmodes.org/bsw/zwei/brainmodes) for information about past BrainModes meetings back to 2007. Archives of another annual meeting build around similar principles - the Brain Connectivity Workshop - going back to 2002 can be found [here](https://www.brain-connectivity-workshop.org/bsw/zwei/bcw).



## Theme and Program

The nominal ***theme*** this year is *"multi-scale mathematical modelling and organizational principles in neural dynamics, cognition, and computational psychiatry"*. 

Confirmed keynote speakers include ***Karl Friston***, ***Joana Cabral***, ***Axel Hutt***, ***Steve Coombes***, and ***Chris Mathys***. See [here]() for the full list of speakers and preliminary conference program. 

Conference programming will include *keynote talks*, *oral sessions*, *panel discussions*, *poster sessions*, as well as a *special reception* and *social activities*. 



## Register, Visit, and Present

[**Registration is open!**](). Note that numbers are limited, so be sure to register early to guarantee a place.

There are opportunities to present your work: the **poster sessions** and the **late-breaking talks**. 

The top ranking poster presentation submissions will be offered a speaker slot in one of the late-breaking talk sessions. 

[Submit your abstract here]() to secure a poster presentation slot and to be considered for the a talk. 

See [here]() for travel and accomodation info.



## Venue
 
The ***venue*** this year is **Toronto, Canada**, at the [Fields Institute for Mathematical Sciences](https://fields.utoronto.ca). The BrainModes planning committee are excited to be partnering with the organizers of the [2025 Fields Institute Thematic Program in Mathematical Neuroscience](), which is hosting a series of meetings, visiting researchers, and facilitated collaborations in Toronto and Ottawa during the second half of the year. We are also delighted to be featuring this year's [Fields Distinguished Lecturer Series]() as an integrated part of the BrainModes conference program.

Right next door to Fields is the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics (KCNI) at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) College Street site. KCNI Scientists Drs. John Griffiths and Andreea Diaconescu are leading the BrainModes organizing committee, and look forward to hosting visitors at Fields, KCNI, and Toronto more generally.
